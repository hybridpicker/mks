# 🎉 CKEditor Successfully Removed!

## Summary
CKEditor has been completely removed from your Django project, eliminating the security vulnerability.

## What Was Done

### 1. Removed CKEditor from Django Settings
- ❌ Removed `'ckeditor'` and `'ckeditor_uploader'` from `INSTALLED_APPS`
- ❌ Removed `CKEDITOR_UPLOAD_PATH = "/media/blog_uploads/"` configuration

### 2. Updated URL Patterns
- ❌ Removed `re_path(r'^ckeditor/', include('ckeditor_uploader.urls'))` from both:
  - `mks/urls.py`
  - `mks/urls_with_2fa.py`

### 3. Updated Models to Use TinyMCE
Replaced `RichTextField` with `HTMLField` in:
- ✅ `home/models.py` - IndexText.content field
- ✅ `projects/models.py` - Project.description field  
- ✅ `instruments/models.py` - Instrument.content field
- ✅ `blog/models.py` was already using HTMLField

### 4. Updated Templates
- ✅ Updated `templates/controlling/index_form.html` to use TinyMCE styling instead of CKEditor

### 5. Updated Requirements
- ❌ Removed `django-ckeditor==6.7.2` from `requirements.txt`
- ✅ Kept `django-tinymce==4.1.0` as the replacement editor

### 6. Database Migrations
Successfully applied migrations to update field types:
- ✅ `home.0006_alter_indextext_content`
- ✅ `instruments.0003_alter_instrument_content` 
- ✅ `projects.0003_alter_project_description`

## Verification ✅
- Django system check passes with no issues
- All migrations applied successfully
- TinyMCE is still available as the rich text editor
- No security warnings about CKEditor

## Benefits
- ✅ **Security**: Eliminated CKEditor security vulnerability
- ✅ **Performance**: Reduced dependencies
